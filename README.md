# Serverless-Web-App-AWS
Building a Static Serverless Web Application on AWS

Sure! Here's the rephrased version of the content:

---

### **Project Overview:**
In this project, you will develop a serverless web application utilizing AWS services such as **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **S3**. The app will enable users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on items stored in a **DynamoDB** table.

### **Project Architecture:**
This project follows the architecture of a **Serverless Web Application** built on AWS.

### **Steps to Build the Project:**
1. **Set up a DynamoDB table** to store the application data (items).
2. **Create a Lambda function** to manage CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
3. **Host static files** (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) using **S3** to serve the web application's frontend.
4. **Configure CloudFront** to distribute the static content from S3 with low latency, ensuring fast access.

### **Expected Outcome:**
Upon completing this project, you'll have a fully functional **serverless web application** deployed on AWS.  
You will gain practical experience working with AWS services like **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **CloudFront** while integrating these services to create a seamless solution.
